# Chell
#### The chad shell.

#### Why?

I want to practice C and Vim. That's literally it. That's kinda the whole purpose of the project. I am using Vim as my main text editor and wanted to try it out in an actual small project.

#### Should I use it?

I don't think so. But go ahead if you want.

#### How is it chad?

It's not.

#### Running Chell

Just run (```gcc chell.c -o chell``` or ```make chell```) and then ```./chell``` from any existing shell and you will get the chell "bash-like" prompt.
